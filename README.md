# MPC-DiscordRPC-Thumbnail

> **Note:** This is an enhanced fork of the original [MPC-DiscordRPC](https://github.com/angeloanan/MPC-DiscordRPC) project with improved thumbnail functionality and better Imgur integration.

## How does this work?
This program simply fetches playback data from MPC-HC / MPC-BE Web Interface, and displays it in your Discord profile through their wonderful [Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) API.

Please note that this only works with [Discord desktop client](https://discordapp.com/download), not with the web app.

## How to install
1. Open your Media Player Classic, go to `View > Options > Player > Web Interface` and enable the following options:
   - Enable `Listen on port:` option (default port is `13579`)
   - Enable `Allow access from localhost only`
   - Enable `Serve pages from:` and set it to `/webroot`
   - Set the default page to `index.html,index.php`

![Enable the option "Listen on port"](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/416273308540207116/428748994307424256/unknown.png)

**Important for thumbnail functionality:** Also configure these additional settings:
   - Enable `Enable compression`
   - Enable `Enable preview` option  
   - Enable `Show debugging information`
   - In the CGI handlers field, add: `ext1=url1;ext2=url2;`

These settings are necessary for the snapshot/thumbnail feature to work correctly with Discord Rich Presence.

2. Install [`Node.JS`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) (we recommend using the latest version).

3. [Download this project as a .zip file](https://github.com/aqemi/MPC-DiscordRPC-Electron/archive/master.zip), extract it and open a terminal window in the project directory. Otherwise, if you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aqemi/MPC-DiscordRPC-Electron.git && cd MPC-DiscordRPC-Electron
```

4. Install dependencies using: 
```sh
npm i
``` 

> Note: You can safely ignore all peer and optional dependencies warnings as they are not required for the program to work.

5. Start the program using: 
```sh
npm start
``` 
or via

```sh
node index.js
``` 

> Note: Using `npm start` will start the program as a background process so you don't need to keep a terminal window open in order to keep the script running. Thus, you may close your terminal window after running this command.

And voil√†! It will now show in your Discord profile what you're watching/listening to on MPC.

If you started the program using `npm start` and need MPC-DiscordRPC to stop showing your playback info, just run:

```
npm stop
```

## How to update

1. Navigate to the directory where did you cloned/downloaded this project and open a terminal window.

2. Stop the program using:

```sh
npm stop
```

3. Update this project by [redownloading this project as a .zip file](https://github.com/aqemi/MPC-DiscordRPC-Electron/archive/master.zip) and replacing the old files. 

   Otherwise, if you have Git installed, run:
   ```sh
   git pull
   ```

4. Start the program again using:
```sh
npm start
```

Now you may close the terminal. The project is fully up to date!

## `config.js` options

#### `exports.port`
Default: `13579`

Port on which MPC Web Interface is running. See the [How to install](#how-to-install) section above to learn more.

#### `exports.ignoreBrackets`
Default: `true`

Whether to omit brackets `[]` and its content in filenames. Useful if you don't want to show on your profile those info tags that usually comes inside brackets in filenames, like `[1080p]`, `[Translator Group Name]`, etc. You can set it to `false` or remove this line to turn off this behavior.

#### `exports.ignoreFiletype`
Default: `false`

Whether to omit filetype. Useful if you don't want to show on your profile the type of the file that is currently open, for example `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.flac`. You can set it to `true` to turn on this behavior.

#### `exports.replaceUnderscore`
Default: `true`

Whether to replace `_` with space. Useful if you have files like `Your_Favourite_Movie`. You can set it to `false` or remove this line to turn off this behavior.

#### `exports.replaceDots`
Default: `true`

Whether to replace dot (`.`) characters (except the file extension one) with spaces. This way, `Your.Favourite.Movie.mp4` will be displayed as `Your Favourite Movie.mp4`. You can set it to `false` or remove this line to turn off this behavior.

#### `exports.showRemainingTime`
Default: `false`

Whether to display the current file's remaining playback time while playing, instead of showing the elapsed time.

#### `exports.imgurClientId`
Default: `'b1499242386d1ad'`

Imgur Client-ID for uploading anonymous images. This is used for the thumbnail/snapshot feature that displays video screenshots in Discord Rich Presence. The default value should work for most users, but you can create your own Imgur application and use your own Client-ID if needed.

## Thumbnail Feature

This fork includes an enhanced thumbnail feature that automatically captures screenshots from your currently playing video and displays them in Discord Rich Presence. The thumbnails are uploaded to Imgur and refreshed every 2 minutes.

### Requirements for Thumbnails
- Make sure all the MPC-HC Web Interface settings mentioned in the installation section are properly configured
- The snapshot feature requires MPC-HC to have the "Enable preview" option enabled
- Thumbnails are automatically resized to 512x512 pixels for optimal Discord display
