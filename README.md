## How does this work?
This program simply fetches playback data from MPC-HC Web Interface, makes it look nicer and displays it in your Discord profile through their wonderful [Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence). 

Please note that it only works with [Discord desktop client](https://discordapp.com/download), not with the website.

## How to install
1. Open Media Player Classic, go to `View > Options > Player > Web Interface` and enable `Listen on port:` option. The default port is `13579`, but if you have changed it, please edit the `config.js` file after you download the project.

2. Install [`Node.JS`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) (we recommend using the latest version). Optional but better, also install [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install).
3. Download this project as a .zip file, extract it and open a terminal window in the project directory. Otherwise, if you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/angeloanan/MPC-HC-DiscordRPC.git && cd MPC-HC-DiscordRPC
```

4. Install dependencies using: 
```sh
npm i && npm i -g forever
``` 

If you prefer using Yarn, run:

```sh
yarn && yarn global add forever
```

5. Start the program using: 
```sh
forever start -s .
``` 
Now you can close the terminal.

And voil√†! It will now show in your Discord profile what you're watching/listening to on MPC-HC. Enjoy.
